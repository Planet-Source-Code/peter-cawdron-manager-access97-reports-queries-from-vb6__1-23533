## Manager Access97 Reports/Queries from VB6


</div>

### Description

If you liked the Report Manager you'll love this. Again, it's very simple but effective. It allows you to manager both your Access queries and reports directly from a VB6 program, which sure beats writing code to do it. Have fun!
 
### More Info
 
Requires Access97. Double clicking a Report or Query will default to open with Excel. (Note: It will not build reports/queries, it assumes you've already done this in Access.)
